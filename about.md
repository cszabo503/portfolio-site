			<p class="profile-body columns small-12 medium-12 large-7">I live and work in the vibrant city of Austin, TX. I have a passion for good design and nothing makes me happier than finding it in unexpected places around town. I currently work for TextureMedia, Inc. as their in-house Graphic Designer, where I focus on designing all marketing and social materials. In my spare time I volunteer for the Big Brother Big Sister Organization, hang out with friends and find new projects I want to dabble in. Overall I like staying busy.</p>
